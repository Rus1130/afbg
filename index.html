    <h1>How to add video</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>If the folder does not exist already, create it. Make it an abbreviated name, or an old name, something short, like "katana" or "k23" for "Prototype-K23".</li>
        <li>Inside of that folder, you would put the <b>mp4 file</b> that is going to be used inside of the wiki template.
            <ul>
                <li>For normal moves, it should be the key to press in order to use that move. So kickboxers first move, Neck Grip, would be <b>1.mp4</b> inside of the <b>kb</b> folder.</li>
                <li>For ults, prefix "u" to the filename. so steel's first ult move would be <b>u1.mp4</b></li>
                <li>For variant moves, suffix with "v". For example, kickboxers aerial variant for move 4 would become <b>4v.mp4</b></li>
                <li>For finishers, suffix with "f". For example, the finisher for greatsword's move 4 would become <b>4f.mp4</b></li>
                <li>For single-use ultimates, the filename should be <b>ultimate.mp4</b></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            To reference the video inside of the Wiki, you must use this template:<br>
            <code>{{Video|name=FOLDER_NAME|move=FILE_NAME}}</code><br>
            So for kickboxers move Neck Grip, you would use:<br>
            <code>{{Video|name=kb|move=1}}</code>
        </li>
    </ol>
